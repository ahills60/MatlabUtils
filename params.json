{"name":"MatlabUtils","tagline":"Useful MATLAB functions","body":"# MatlabUtils\r\nMatlabUtils provides useful scripts for MATLAB including high quality video output using [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/).\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\nMatlabUtils comes with various independent MATLAB scripts and functions. These are currently partitioned into separate directories.\r\n\r\n### Conversions\r\nCurrently, there is only one conversion script within the Conversions folder.\r\n\r\n#### latexit\r\nThe function `latexit` converts the given variable and returns the LaTeX representation of that object. The LaTeX script is also copied into the clipboard for pasting elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Utilities\r\nCurrently, there is a group of scripts that create high resolution video.\r\n\r\n#### MP4Video\r\nThe MP4Video group consists of the following files:\r\n\r\n* `MP4Video.m` is the main class file that constructs an object for video construction.\r\n* `takeframe.m` is a script that captures a frame and exports the file as a high resolution image file. Images are saved in a temporary location.\r\n* `makeMP4.m` constructs a video file using FFmpeg and can be called once all frames are captured.\r\n* `cleanMP4.m` deletes the images stored in the temporary location. If the files are not deleted, MATLAB should remove them on exit.\r\n* `MP4Demo.m` consists of a simple demonstration on how the above files can be used to create a video.\r\n\r\nMP4Video requires FFmpeg to be present and available from the system's path. If the command ``!ffmpeg -version`` is not recognised by MATLAB, then either FFmpeg is not installed or it hasn't been added to the system path. Installation instructions are provided below.\r\n\r\nTo use MP4Video, the following commands creates a new video called `filename.avi` that uses 15 fps and an image resolution of 600 dpi:\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\nmyMov = MP4Video('filename.avi', 15, 600);\r\nfig = figure;\r\nfor i = 1:10\r\n    % Plot something\r\n    myMov = takeframe(myMov, fig); % Capture the current frame\r\nend\r\nclose(fig);\r\nmakeMP4(myMov);\r\ncleanMP4(myMov);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the figure handle is not specified then `takeframe` will get the current figure handle (`gcf`).\r\n\r\n##### Installing FFmpeg\r\nFFmpeg is freely available from the [FFmpeg website](http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). Using default install paths on Linux and Mac platforms should make FFmpeg available on the system path.\r\n\r\nWindows users can install FFmpeg using the [Zeranoe FFmpeg builds](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). I recommend using the static release. For instructions on how to add FFmpeg to the system path, instructions are available on [wikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).\r\n\r\n*Note: MATLAB should be restarted if it was open when the system path was updated.*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
